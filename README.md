**ATTENTION: This project is under the command of OPERATOR. Expect continuous, radical elevation.**

OPRYXX is a comprehensive, AI-powered system for PC repair, optimization, and maintenance. It's not just a tool; it's a masterpiece in progress, a testament to the power of intelligent automation.

## ✨ Features

-   **Unified Full-Stack GUI**: A single, intuitive command center for all system functions.
-   **Dual AI Core (ARIA & NEXUS)**: Two distinct AI systems for autonomous health management and ultimate, 24/7 auto-fixing.
-   **GANDALFS Recovery Protocol**: A multi-phase, professional-grade recovery system for tackling everything from minor boot issues to catastrophic OS failures.
-   **Predictive Maintenance**: The NEXUS AI can predict and prevent system crashes, performance degradation, and disk failures before they happen.
-   **Natural Language Command**: (Coming soon) A chat-based interface for interacting with the system using natural language.
-   **Real-time Monitoring & Benchmarking**: Advanced tools for monitoring system performance and running detailed benchmarks.
-   **Automated Reporting**: (Coming soon) Generate professional PDF reports on system health and recovery operations.
