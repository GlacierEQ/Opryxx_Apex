# 🚀 OPRYXX UNIFIED SYSTEM - MASTER DOCUMENTATION

**A new standard in system optimization, forged by OPERATOR.**

## 🔍 Overview

OPRYXX is a comprehensive, AI-powered system for PC repair, optimization, and maintenance. This document provides a detailed overview of the system's architecture, features, and development practices.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Unified Full-Stack GUI**: A single, intuitive command center for all system functions.
-   **Dual AI Core (ARIA & NEXUS)**: Two distinct AI systems for autonomous health management and ultimate, 24/7 auto-fixing.
-   **GANDALFS Recovery Protocol**: A multi-phase, professional-grade recovery system for tackling everything from minor boot issues to catastrophic OS failures.
-   **Predictive Maintenance**: The NEXUS AI can predict and prevent system crashes, performance degradation, and disk failures before they happen.
-   **And much more**: See the main `README.md` for a full list of features.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Windows 10/11
-   Python 3.8+
-   Administrator privileges

-   **And more**: Explore the other tabs to discover the full power of the OPRYXX system.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

All configuration is now handled through the **Settings** tab in the Unified Full Stack GUI. The old `config.ini` file and command-line options are no longer used.

## 🚀 Build and Automation System

This project features a comprehensive build and automation system designed to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes. The system is built around a powerful `Makefile` and modern Python tooling.

### 🛠️ Key Features

-   **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
-   **One-Command Setup**: Get started quickly with `make dev-setup`
-   **Automated Testing**: Run tests with coverage and generate reports
-   **Code Quality**: Enforce consistent code style and catch issues early
-   **Containerization**: Docker support for development and production
-   **CI/CD Ready**: Pre-configured for GitHub Actions

### 🚦 Quick Start

1.  **Set up the development environment**:
    ```bash
    make dev-setup
    ```

2.  **Run tests**:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

3.  **Build the package**:
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

4.  **Run locally**:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
