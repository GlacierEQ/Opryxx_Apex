# OPRYXX Windsurf AI Integration Rules

## Core OPRYXX Principles
1. **24/7 Autonomous Operation**
   - AI systems must operate continuously without human intervention
   - Self-healing and auto-recovery capabilities required
   - Performance monitoring with automatic optimization

2. **Memory & Performance Excellence**
   - Memory leak detection with 10MB threshold
   - GPU/NPU acceleration utilization
   - Real-time performance scoring (0-100 scale)

3. **Recovery & Resilience**
   - Emergency recovery protocols always available
   - Safe mode exit capabilities
   - Boot repair and system diagnostics
