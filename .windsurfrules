# Windsurf AI Platform Rules

## Core Principles
1. **Safety First**
   - All AI outputs must be filtered for harmful, unethical, or biased content
   - Implement strict content moderation at all API endpoints
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing

2. **Transparency**
   - Clearly indicate AI-generated content to end-users
   - Provide confidence scores for AI-generated responses
   - Maintain detailed audit logs of all AI interactions

3. **Performance**
   - Response times under 2 seconds for 95% of requests
   - 99.9% uptime SLA for production services
   - Efficient resource utilization and auto-scaling

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, etc.)
- Minimum 80% test coverage for all production code
- Static code analysis in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates and security patches

### API Standards
- RESTful design principles
- Versioned endpoints (e.g., /v1/...)
- Standardized error responses
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

### AI/ML Best Practices
- Version control for models and datasets
- Model performance monitoring in production
- A/B testing framework for model updates
- Fairness and bias evaluation metrics
- Explainability for model predictions

## Security & Compliance
- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
- Data minimization and retention policies
- GDPR/CCPA compliance tools
- Regular security training for developers
- Incident response plan

## Monitoring & Observability
- Centralized logging (ELK stack or similar)
- Real-time performance metrics
- Anomaly detection for system behavior
- User feedback collection and analysis

## Deployment
- Containerized applications (Dfile was not found in the file system, and the file is not a memory file.le to create the file.
